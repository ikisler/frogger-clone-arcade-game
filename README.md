# Frogger Clone Readme
###HTML5 canvas and Javascript portions developed by Isabeau Kisler
**Game engine code developed by Udacity**

###Running the Program
Down the folder and all its files, then double click on 'index.html'.
**OR**
Go to my [github page](http://ikisler.github.io/frogger-clone-arcade-game/) to view the game.

###Gameplay
Get the character across the road to the water.  Avoid the bugs, as they send you back to start.

**Controls:** User arrow keys to move character up, down, right, or left.

This project is part of Udacity's Front-End Nanodegree program.
